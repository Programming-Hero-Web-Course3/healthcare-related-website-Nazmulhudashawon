            <p>Prevent you from getting COVID-19 or from becoming seriously ill or dying of COVID-19
                Prevent you from spreading the COVID-19 virus to others
                Add to the number of people in the community who are protected from getting COVID-19
                Prevent the COVID-19 virus from spreading and replicating, which allows it to mutate and possibly become more resistant to vaccines</p>
            <h2>Are the vaccines safe?</h2>
            <p>
                Data must show that a COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can give emergency use authorization or approval. The safety of COVID-19 vaccines is closely monitored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and FDA.

                The FDA has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, now called Comirnaty, to prevent COVID-19 in people age 16 and older. The FDA approved Comirnaty after data found the vaccine is safe and effective.

                Vaccines with emergency use authorization by the FDA include:

                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 12 to 15
                Moderna COVID-19 vaccine
                Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine
            </p>
            <h2>
                Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine if I’ve already had COVID-19?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Getting COVID-19 offers some natural protection or immunity from reinfection with the COVID-19 virus. But it’s not clear how long this protection lasts.

                Because it’s possible to get reinfected and COVID-19 can cause severe medical complications, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who have already had COVID-19 get a COVID-19 vaccine.

                In addition, COVID-19 vaccination might offer better protection than getting sick with COVID-19. A recent study showed that unvaccinated people who already had COVID-19 are more than twice as likely as fully vaccinated people to get reinfected with COVID-19.

                Recent research also suggests that people who got COVID-19 in 2020 and then received mRNA vaccines produce very high levels of antibodies that are likely effective against current and, possibly, future variants. Some scientists call this hybrid immunity. Further research is needed.

                If you were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine.
